#  Gambling addiction now recognized as a mental health disorder

Gambling addiction is now recognized as a mental health disorder, according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( DSM-5 ). The decision was made in response to growing evidence that gambling addiction is a real condition that can lead to serious consequences, including financial ruin, job loss, and damage to relationships.

The DSM-5 defines gambling addiction as "a persistent and recurrent maladaptive pattern of gambling behavior," characterized by six or more of the following symptoms:

Gambling larger amounts of money than intended
Losing Control: Gambling more money than planned, gambling when experiencing negative consequences as a result of gambling, chasing losses
Trying but Unable to Stop Gambling: Repeated unsuccessful efforts to quit or cut back on gambling
Preoccupation with Gambling: Thoughts about gambling all or most of the time, including planning how to get money to gamble or thinking about what bets to make
Irritability or Restlessness When Not Gambling: Feeling antsy or irritable when not able to gamble, needing stimulation from gambling activities
Repetitive Behaviors Associated With Gambling: Engaging in rituals associated with gambling (e.g., visiting certain casinos or betting tips), concealing gambling activity from loved ones

The condition can be very harmful, leading people to risk their jobs, relationships, and financial security. A study by the National Council on Problem Gambling found that problem gamblers are three times more likely than non-problem gamblers to have suffered a major depressive episode in the past year. They are also six times more likely to have had suicidal thoughts in the past year. According to another study, 78 percent of people with a diagnosed gambling addiction have an annual household income of less than $50,000.

While there is no one-size-fits-all treatment for gambling addiction, counseling and behavioral therapies are often recommended. Medications may also be prescribed if a person has co-occurring disorders such as depression or anxiety. With treatment, many people are able to overcome their addiction and rebuild their lives.

#  Gambling addiction may be considered a disease by the World Health Organization

Gambling addiction may soon be classified as a disease by the World Health Organization.

The WHO is currently reviewing gambling addiction and seeking public comments on the matter. If gambling addiction is classified as a disease, it would be included in the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), which is the global standard for diagnosing and tracking diseases.

Gambling addiction is a serious problem that can have devastating consequences for individuals and families. The National Council on Problem Gambling estimates that 1 in 5 Americans has a problem with gambling.

There are several signs that you may be addicted to gambling, including:

· Feeling an uncontrollable urge to gamble
· Gambling more than you can afford to lose
· Lying to friends or family about how much money you’ve gambled or how often you’ve been gambling
· Hiding your gambling activity from others
· Excessively spending time thinking about or planning your next gambling venture
· Experiencing anxiety or negative emotions when you can’t gamble

#  New study finds gambling addiction should be classified as an official disease

A new study has found that gambling addiction should be classified as an official disease, in the same category as drug addiction and alcoholism. The study, which was published in the Journal of Gambling Studies, found that gambling addiction is a real and serious mental health disorder that can have devastating consequences for people’s lives.

Gambling addiction is a form of behavioral addiction that involves repeatedly gambling despite negative consequences. People with gambling addiction often lose large sums of money, suffer from financial problems, experience relationship difficulties, and suffer from other mental health disorders.

The study found that gambling addiction should be classified as an impulse-control disorder, along with drug addiction and alcoholism. Impulse-control disorders are characterized by a lack of self-control and a tendency to act on impulses, even when those impulses may be harmful to oneself or others.

The study authors say that classifying gambling addiction as an impulse-control disorder would make it easier to get treatment for it. They also say that it would help to raise awareness about the seriousness of gambling addiction and its potential consequences.

Gambling addiction is a relatively new field of research, and there is still much we don’t know about it. More research is needed to determine the best way to treat it. However, the findings of this study suggest that gambling addiction should be taken seriously as a mental health disorder and that treatment should be available for those who need it.

#  When gambling addiction is named a disease: What does this mean for addicts?

Gambling addiction has been in the news a lot lately. This is because the American Psychiatric Association (APA) has decided to include it in the DSM-5, which is the standard classification of mental disorders used by mental health professionals in the United States.

This decision by the APA has caused a lot of controversy. Some people feel that gambling addiction should be treated like any other addiction, while others feel that it should be treated as a disease.

What does this decision mean for addicts?

There are a few things that this decision means for addicts. First of all, it means that gambling addiction is officially recognized as a disease. This will help to ensure that addicts receive the treatment they need.

Second of all, it means that insurance companies will be more likely to cover treatment for gambling addiction. This is because gambling addiction is now considered to be a disease rather than just a bad habit.

Third of all, it means that there will be more research on gambling addiction. This research will help us to better understand how to treat this disorder.

#  How will classifying gambling addiction as a disease impact those affected by it?

Gambling addiction is a compulsive disorder that is characterized by a strong urge to gamble and continued gambling in spite of negative consequences. It is estimated that between 2 and 5 percent of the population experiences gambling addiction, making it one of the most common addictions in the world.

Despite its prevalence, gambling addiction has not been classified as a mental health disorder by the American Psychiatric Association (APA). This may soon change, as the APA is currently considering including gambling addiction in its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM).

Classifying gambling addiction as a mental health disorder would have important implications for those affected by it. For example, it would increase awareness about gambling addiction and could lead to more resources being dedicated to treating it. Additionally, those with gambling addiction would be able to access treatment through their health insurance plan.

There are mixed opinions on whether or not classifying gambling addiction as a mental health disorder is the right thing to do. Some feel that it will help those affected by it get the treatment they need, while others argue that it will contribute to stigma surrounding gambling addiction. Nonetheless, it is clear that classifying gambling addiction as a disease has the potential to improve the lives of those affected by it.
