#  What is the objective of the game?

The objective of the game is to score points by throwing the disc into the opposing team’s end zone. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins.

# How do I play?

Players must stand within 3 yards of the front edge of the playing surface and cannot move until the disc is released. The player who releases the disc is called the thrower and other players are known as defenders. The defender who is closest to the thrower when the disc is released becomes the marker. The marker must stay within 3 yards of the thrower until the disc has been released. If any part of a player’s body crosses over the sideline or endzone, that player has committed a foul. Play then restarts with a check from central midfield.

There are two ways to score points in Ultimate: by scoring a goal or by completing an “attacking throw”. A goal is scored when a player throws the disc into the opposing team’s end zone and it remains there. An attacking throw is completed when a player catches a thrown disc while standing in bounds in their opponent’s end zone.

#  What are the controls?

The controls for a flying machine can be the steering wheel, throttle, joystick, and pedals. The function of the controls is to allow the pilot to maneuver the aircraft.

There are many types of control surfaces on an airplane. The most important ones are the ailerons, rudder, and elevator. These surfaces create lift or drag to control the airplane's movement in three dimensions: up-and-down (elevator), side-to-side (rudder), and front-to-back (ailerons).

The pilot uses the yoke or joystick to control these surfaces. For example, when the pilot wants to go up, they would move the yoke/joystick forward. This would cause the elevators to increase lift on the back of the airplane and raise it into the air. To go down, they would move it backward and the airplane would descend.

To turn left or right, they would use the ailerons. These are located on the wings of the airplane and when moved up or down will cause the airplane to bank in that direction. The rudder is used to keep the airplane facing straight ahead while flying. It's located at the back of the plane and when moved left or right will cause it to yaw in that direction.
