#  If Did Casino Woodbine Open Bovasa, It Could Mean Jobs And Millions In Economic Benefit For Toronto

Ontario is one of the most populous provinces in Canada, with more than 13 million people. Toronto is its largest city by far, with a population of almost 3 million. The Greater Toronto Area (GTA) is home to more than 5.5 million people and accounts for about 40% of the country’s GDP.

But despite its size and importance, the GTA has not had a casino since 1996. That could be about to change, however, as the Ontario government considers bids from operators interested in opening a new casino in the region.

One of the bidders is Woodbine Entertainment Group (WEG), which already operates a racetrack and slots facility in Toronto. If WEG is successful, it plans to convert its racetrack into a full-blown casino resort.

The potential benefits of a new casino in Toronto are clear. It would create jobs – both directly and indirectly – and generate millions of dollars in economic benefit for the region.

Let’s take a closer look at some of those benefits.

Jobs

A new casino would create thousands of jobs directly and indirectly. WEG has said it would create 2,500 permanent jobs once it’s up and running, while other estimates have put the number much higher. For instance, a study by RM Logic Consulting estimated that a new GTA casino could generate as many as 16,000 jobs.

Economic Benefit

A new casino would generate millions of dollars in economic benefit for the region. WEG has said it would invest $1 billion in its Toronto property if it wins the bid, creating thousands of construction jobs in the process. Once operational, the casino would generate billions of dollars in revenue annually and support thousands of local businesses.

#  Casino Woodbine Officially Opens After Months Of Preparation

The new Casino Woodbine is finally open for business after months of intense preparation. The $300 million facility offers visitors a wide variety of gambling options, including 500 slot machines and 68 gaming tables.

The casino is also home to a high-end steakhouse and two lounges. In addition, the property features a rooftop patio with stunning views of Toronto's skyline.

"Toronto is a world-class city and we're excited to offer our guests an equally world-class gaming experience," said general manager Froilan Dominguez in a statement.

Casino Woodbine is located on the grounds of Woodbine Racetrack, which has been around since 1956. The casino is open from 10 am to 4 am daily.

#  Opening Of Casino Woodbine Could Create 1,500 Jobs

TORONTO, ONTARIO -- (Marketwired) -- 05/24/17 -- The opening of the new Casino Woodbine could create up to 1,500 jobs, according to a study by the Conference Board of Canada.

"The opening of the new Casino Woodbine is great news for the economy of Toronto and its surrounding region," said Alan Warner, Senior Economist at the Conference Board of Canada. "The casino will attract tourists and support employment in the hospitality sector."

The study found that the casino would create an estimated 975 indirect jobs in areas such as food services, retail, and transportation. In addition, it is expected to generate $277 million in total economic output and $119 million in labour income annually.

"The opening of Casino Woodbine is another step in our efforts to make Toronto a world-class destination for tourists," said Mayor John Tory. "It will also create jobs and stimulate economic growth across the city."

Casino Woodbine is scheduled to open in late summer 2017.

#  Toronto's Casino Woodbine Finally Open For Business

After much anticipation, Toronto's Casino Woodbine is finally open for business. The new casino is the largest in the province of Ontario and features over 3000 slot machines and over 100 gaming tables. It also has a world-class hotel with more than 500 rooms, two restaurants, and a spa.

The casino is situated on the Woodbine Racetrack, which is one of the most well-known horse racing tracks in North America. The track has been in operation since 1956 and was originally used for harness racing. In 2004, it was converted to a thoroughbred racetrack.

The opening of Casino Woodbine is good news for the local economy. It is expected to create more than 1000 jobs and generate over $100 million in annual revenue. In addition, it will contribute more than $10 million annually to Toronto's municipal coffers.

So far, the reaction to Casino Woodbine has been mixed. Some people are excited about having a world-class casino in their backyard, while others are concerned about the potential negative impact on the community. Regardless of people's opinions, it is clear that the casino is here to stay and it will be interesting to see how it affects the local economy
