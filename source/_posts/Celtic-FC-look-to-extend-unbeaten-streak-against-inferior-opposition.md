#  Celtic FC look to extend unbeaten streak against inferior opposition

After a morale-boosting win over bitter rivals Rangers, Celtic FC will be looking to extend their unbeaten streak when they take on Hamilton Academical at the New Douglas Park.

The Hoops come into this game as strong favourites given their recent form and the fact that Hamilton have been struggling in the league so far this season.

Celtic have won all but two of their eleven matches so far this season, with their only defeats coming against Paris Saint-Germain and Aberdeen. Brendan Rodgers' side are now unbeaten in their last forty domestic games, a run which stretches back to the beginning of last season.

Hamilton have only managed to win four of their eleven matches this season, with their most recent victory coming against Dundee last weekend. They currently find themselves in eleventh place in the table and are already thirteen points behind Celtic.

It is likely that Rodgers will rotate his squad for this game, with some of his key players likely to be given a rest ahead of Wednesday's Champions League clash with Bayern Munich. However, Celtic should still have enough quality to get the three points against Hamilton.

Olivier Ntcham is likely to start in midfield for Celtic, and he will be looking to keep up his impressive form after scoring twice in his last two appearances. Moussa Dembele could also start up front, and he will be looking to score his first goal since returning from injury.

Hamilton are likely to give everything they've got in this game in order to get a result, but Celtic should have too much firepower for them and should eventually win comfortably.

#  Celtic FC -15 odds to beat the juice in athletics betting

There is no stopping Celtic FC when it comes to football betting, but can they conquer the sports scene?

The Glaswegian outfit are well known for their prowess in the beautiful game, with a record that speaks for itself. However, what about their chances when taking on other sports?

Betting odds of -15 make Celtic FC clear favourites to come out on top against their opponents in the athletics category. Of course, there is always an element of risk associated with any type of wager, but if you’re looking to back Brendan Rodgers’s side then now may be the time.

Athletics isn’t the only sport in which Celtic FC are tipped to do well. The club are also favourites in the basketball and tennis markets, with odds of -9 and -6 respectively. This makes them one of the most versatile sides around and could lead to some serious profits for those who back them.

So, whether you’re looking to place a bet on Celtic FC or another team, it’s always important to do your research first. With so much at stake, you certainly don’t want to leave anything to chance.

#  Celtic FC hold all the cards as they visit weak side in latest round of fixtures

With just a handful of games remaining in the season, Celtic FC are sitting pretty at the top of the table. Their nearest rivals, Aberdeen FC, have started to falter in recent weeks, opening up a significant gap between themselves and the chasing pack. This has created something of a cushion for Celtic as they head into their final fixtures, giving them plenty of breathing room as they look to clinch their seventh successive title.

This weekend, they travel to Inverness CT – a side who have been struggling all season long. The Highlanders are currently second from bottom in the table, and they have won just two league games all season. They have also conceded more goals than any other team in the division, so it’s fair to say that Celtic will be confident of picking up all three points in this game.

Inverness will no doubt be determined to put on a good show for their home fans, but it’s hard to see them getting anything against Neil Lennon’s side. With such an impressive record against teams in the bottom half of the table, Celtic will be confident of coming away with another win here. They may not be able to pull away from Aberdeen any further, but they can still make sure that they go into the playoffs as champions.

#  Strong start key for Celtic FC as they take on side struggling domestically

Celtic FC travelled to Aberdeen on Saturday to take on a side who have been struggling domestically this season. McInnes has come under some pressure from the fans, with the Dons sitting in 7th place in the Premiership, 12 points off Celtic at the top of the table.

Aberdeen started brightly and created the first real chance of the game when Shinnie’s free-kick was well saved by Gordon. It was Celtic who would take the lead in the 15th minute, though, as Rogic’s corner was headed home by Jozo Simunovic. Aberdeen continued to create chances but couldn’t find an equaliser before half-time.

The home side started strongly after the break and had a number of chances, but it was Celtic who doubled their lead in the 77th minute when Leigh Griffiths fired home from 20 yards out. The goal killed the game off as a contest and Celtic held on to record a 2-0 win.

It was an important win for Celtic, who maintain their unbeaten domestic record this season and open up a five-point gap at the top of the table. They will now turn their attention to next week’s Champions League tie against Bayern Munich.
