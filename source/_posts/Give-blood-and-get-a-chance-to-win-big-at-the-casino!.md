For those who love to gamble and enjoy a thrill, there’s no need to choose between donating blood and spending a night at the casino. Now, donors nationwide have the chance to win big just by giving blood.

The Red Cross is partnering with several casinos in order to offer a promotion for donors. For each donation, participants will receive a free entry into a raffle for a chance to win up to $1,000 in free slot play.

This promotion is being offered at Harrah’s resort casinos, as well as other properties owned by Caesars Entertainment. This includes locations in Nevada, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Missouri, and Indiana.

According to Red Cross spokesman Tony Sheldon, this is the perfect way for avid gamblers to do some good.

“This is a great opportunity for people who enjoy gambling to also donate blood and help save lives,” Sheldon said in a statement. “What could be more fun than that?”

Donors must be 18 years of age or older and present valid identification at the time of donation. The promotion will run through September 9th at all participating locations.

“We wanted to create a game that was fun to play, but that also had a real-world impact,” said developer Bryan Hoss. “By partnering with our local blood bank, we can help support their important work and help save lives.”

The game has already generated significant interest, with pre-orders and pre-sales totaling over 2,000 copies! And all of this support will go towards helping those in need in our local community.
