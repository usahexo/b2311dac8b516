#  Gambling age at California casinos set to increase

Beginning Jan. 1, 2020, the minimum gambling age at casinos in California will increase from 18 to 21.

The change was announced by the state’s Gambling Control Commission on Wednesday, Aug. 28. It comes after a proposal from the commission to hike the age was approved by state regulators in May.

The new requirement will apply to all card games, slot machines and other casino games.

Commission Chairman A.G. Burnett said in a statement that the commission is “committed to protecting California’s citizens and our gaming industry by ensuring that those who participate in gambling activities are of legal age.”

Supporters of the increase say it will help protect young people from developing gambling addictions. But opponents argue that it will simply push 18- to 20-year-olds into black market or offshore betting operations.
