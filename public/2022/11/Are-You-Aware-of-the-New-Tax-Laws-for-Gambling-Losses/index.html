        <h1 id="Are-You-Aware-of-the-New-Tax-Laws-for-Gambling-Losses"><a href="#Are-You-Aware-of-the-New-Tax-Laws-for-Gambling-Losses" class="headerlink" title="Are You Aware of the New Tax Laws for Gambling Losses?"></a>Are You Aware of the New Tax Laws for Gambling Losses?</h1><p>In 2018, the federal government passed a new tax law that affects individuals who experience gambling losses. This new law allows taxpayers to deduct their gambling losses from their gambling income.</p>
<p>This change is a big deal for taxpayers who gamble, as it will allow them to reduce the amount of money they owe in taxes. Previously, taxpayers were not able to deduct their gambling losses from their gambling income.</p>
<p>The new tax law applies to all forms of gambling, including casino games, lottery tickets, and sports betting. However, there are some restrictions on how much you can deduct.</p>
<p>You can only deduct your losses up to the amount of your winnings. So if you had $1,000 in winnings and $2,000 in losses, you can only deduct $1,000 in losses.</p>
<p>Additionally, you cannot claim a deduction for gambling losses if you are subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT).</p>
<p>The new tax law took effect on January 1st, 2018. So if you have experienced any gambling losses in 2018, you can now claim those losses on your tax return.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about how the new tax law affects gambling losses, please contact your tax professional.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-File-a-Gambling-Loss-on-Your-Taxes-in-2018"><a href="#How-to-File-a-Gambling-Loss-on-Your-Taxes-in-2018" class="headerlink" title="How to File a Gambling Loss on Your Taxes in 2018"></a>How to File a Gambling Loss on Your Taxes in 2018</h1><p>In the United States, gambling losses are tax deductible. This means that you can claim a portion of your losses as a deduction on your annual income tax return.</p>
<p>However, there are specific rules that must be followed in order to qualify for this deduction. For example, you can only claim gambling losses if you itemize your deductions on your return. Additionally, the amount of losses that can be deducted is limited to the amount of winnings that are reported on your return.</p>
<p>If you have gambling losses for the year, you will need to complete Form 1040 Schedule A, Itemized Deductions. On this form, you will report your total gambling winnings and losses for the year. You will then subtract the amount of your losses from the amount of your winnings to determine your taxable income from gambling.</p>
<p>The good news is that you can carry over any unused losses to future years. This means that if you don’t have any gambling winnings in a particular year, you can still use your losses to reduce your taxable income.</p>
<p>It’s important to keep in mind that gambling income is considered taxable income regardless of whether or not it is reported on your return. This means that you could be subject to penalties and interest if you fail to report this income correctly.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about how to file a gambling loss on your taxes, please contact an accountant or tax specialist for assistance.</p>
<h1 id="What-You-Need-to-Know-About-Reporting-Gambling-Winnings-and-Losses-in-2018"><a href="#What-You-Need-to-Know-About-Reporting-Gambling-Winnings-and-Losses-in-2018" class="headerlink" title="What You Need to Know About Reporting Gambling Winnings and Losses in 2018"></a>What You Need to Know About Reporting Gambling Winnings and Losses in 2018</h1><p>As tax season rapidly approaches, taxpayers are scrambling to understand the new changes to the tax code. One of the most important things to understand is how to report your gambling winnings and losses. Here’s what you need to know:</p>
<ol>
<li>Gambling income is taxable.</li>
</ol>
<p>This one may seem obvious, but it’s worth mentioning. Whether you won or lost, any income generated from gambling is taxable. This includes money won from traditional casino games like blackjack and slots, as well as prizes and payouts from fantasy sports contests.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>You can claim gambling losses as a deduction.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you lost money gambling last year, you can claim those losses as a deduction on your tax return. This can help offset any taxable gambling income you may have had. Just remember that you can only deduct losses up to the amount of your gambling income. So if you had $1,000 in gambling income but $2,000 in losses, you can only deduct $1,000 of your losses on your return.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>You must report all gambling winnings and losses.</li>
</ol>
<p>Even if you didn’t itemize deductions last year, you still need to report your gambling income and losses on your tax return. This information is reported on Form 1040, Schedule A (PDF). Be sure to keep careful track of all of your winnings and losses throughout the year, so you have everything ready when it comes time to file your return.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>The rules for reporting vary depending on whether you are a professional gambler or not.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you are a professional gambler, then different rules apply for how you report your income and expenses. For more information on this, consult IRS Publication 535 (PDF). Generally speaking, though, professional gamblers must report all of their income and expenses on Schedule C (PDF), rather than Schedule A like non-professional gamblers.</p>
<h1 id="When-to-Report-Gambling-Winnings-and-Losses-on-Your-Tax-Return"><a href="#When-to-Report-Gambling-Winnings-and-Losses-on-Your-Tax-Return" class="headerlink" title="When to Report Gambling Winnings and Losses on Your Tax Return"></a>When to Report Gambling Winnings and Losses on Your Tax Return</h1><p>There is no universal answer to this question since it depends on your personal tax situation. In general, you should report gambling winnings and losses if they exceed a certain amount based on the type of gambling activity.</p>
<p>For casino gambling, the IRS generally treats all winnings as taxable income. This means that you must report any amount you won over your original bet as income on your tax return. However, you can claim a deduction for any gambling losses up to the amount of your winnings. So if you had a net win of $1,000 in casino gambling, you would report the full $1,000 as income and also claim a deduction of $1,000 for your losses.</p>
<p>For horse racing, the rules are a little different. You only have to report any gains above your purchase price (including wagers and commissions) as income. So if you had a net gain of $100 from horse racing, you would only report $100 as income on your tax return. However, you can still claim a deduction for any losses up to the amount of your gains.</p>
<p>For other types of gambling such as lotteries and poker tournaments, the rules vary depending on whether the winnings are considered “ordinary income” or capital gains. Gambling wins that are considered ordinary income are subject to taxation at regular income tax rates, while capital gains are typically taxed at lower rates. To determine whether a gambling win is considered ordinary or capital gain, you need to look at the underlying asset that was won. For instance, if you won a car in a poker tournament, that would be considered a capital gain since cars are considered assets. However, if you won cash in a poker tournament, that would be considered ordinary income since cash is not considered an asset.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that regardless of whether your gambling winnings are treated as ordinary or capital gains, they will still be subject to self-employment taxes if you earned them through gambling activities performed as a business venture. So if you’re in the business of gambling, be sure to report all of your winnings and losses on Schedule C along with other relevant business expenses.</p>
<p>As with most things related to taxes, it’s best to speak with an accountant or tax specialist who can help advise you on how to properly report your gambling earnings and losses.</p>
<h1 id="Get-Ready-to-Report-Your-Gambling-Losses-This-Year"><a href="#Get-Ready-to-Report-Your-Gambling-Losses-This-Year" class="headerlink" title="Get Ready to Report Your Gambling Losses This Year!"></a>Get Ready to Report Your Gambling Losses This Year!</h1><p>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has announced that the deadline for taxpayers to report their gambling losses for the 2017 tax year is April 15, 2019. So if you’ve been hitting the slots, betting on your favorite sports team, or playing poker with friends, it’s time to tally up your losses and submit them on your tax return.</p>
<p>Your gambling losses are deductible to the extent of your gambling winnings, so it’s important to keep track of both. If you don’t have records of your winnings and losses, you can still claim a deduction based on an estimate, but you’ll need to attach a statement explaining how you arrived at that estimate.</p>
<p>Gambling losses can be claimed as a deduction on Form 1040, Schedule A. They are also subject to the 2% AGI floor, so you can only deduct gambling losses to the extent that they exceed 2% of your adjusted gross income (AGI). So if your AGI is $50,000, your maximum deduction for gambling losses is $1,000 ($50,000 x 2%).</p>
<p>You can also deduct any applicable state and local taxes on gambling winnings and losses. For example, if you live in New York and earn $5,000 in taxable gambling winnings during the year, you would owe New York state income tax of $500 ($5,000 x 10% &#x3D; $500). You can also deduct your New York state gambling loss of $2,000 ($5,000 - $3,000 &#x3D; $2,000), which would reduce your taxable income by $1,500 ($2,000 - $500 &#x3D; $1,500).</p>
<p>There are some other important points to keep in mind when reporting gambling income and losses:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Gambling income includes not just cash prizes but also the fair market value of any non-cash prizes such as cars or trips.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Gambling losses include not just money lost but also any expenses related to gambling activity such as transportation costs, lodging costs, and food expenses.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You can only claim a deduction for expenses related to winning bets. For example, you can’t deduct the cost of buying a lottery ticket or paying an entry fee for a poker tournament.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You must itemize deductions in order to claim a deduction for gambling losses. If you take the standard deduction instead of itemizing deductions on your tax return, you cannot claim a deduction for gambling losses.</p>
</li>
</ul>
