        <h1 id="Juventus-take-commanding-lead-with-win-over-Napoli"><a href="#Juventus-take-commanding-lead-with-win-over-Napoli" class="headerlink" title="Juventus take commanding lead with win over Napoli"></a>Juventus take commanding lead with win over Napoli</h1><p>Juventus have taken a commanding lead in the Serie A title race, with a 2-0 win over rivals Napoli on Sunday.</p>
<p>Mario Mandzukic opened the scoring for Juventus in the first half, before Cristiano Ronaldo sealed the victory in injury time.</p>
<p>This result means that Juventus now lead Napoli by nine points at the top of the table, with just seven games remaining.</p>
<p>Napoli started strongly but Juventus gradually took control of the game and took the lead in the 38th minute. Paulo Dybala played a ball into the box for Mandzukic, who chested it down and volleyed home from close range.</p>
<p>Ronaldo almost made it 2-0 just before halftime but his effort was saved by David Ospina.</p>
<p>Napoli came out fighting after halftime but they were unable to break down the Juve defence. Ronaldo then made sure of all three points for Juventus in injury time, as he fired home from close range after a low cross from Douglas Costa.</p>
<p>This result means that Juventus are now one step closer to their eighth consecutive Serie A title.</p>
<h1 id="Roma-pull-off-upset-to-keep-pressure-on-league-leaders"><a href="#Roma-pull-off-upset-to-keep-pressure-on-league-leaders" class="headerlink" title="Roma pull off upset to keep pressure on league leaders"></a>Roma pull off upset to keep pressure on league leaders</h1><p>AS Roma have upset the odds by beating Serie A leaders Juventus 2-1 in a tense encounter at the Stadio Olimpico. Goals from Daniele De Rossi and Radja Nainggolan cancelled out Paulo Dybala’s opener as Roma moved to within one point of their opponents, with a game in hand.</p>
<p>The home side were on the back foot for most of the first half but took the lead in stunning fashion 10 minutes before halftime when De Rossi unleashed an unstoppable curling effort past Gianluigi Buffon from 25 yards. Juve hit back soon after the break through Dybala, but Roma refused to give up and equalised soon after through Nainggolan’s deflected effort. The visitors looked to have won it when Gonzalo Higuain headed home late on, but Roma held on for a famous victory.</p>
<p>It was a deserved win for Luciano Spalletti’s side, who have been in excellent form in recent weeks. In contrast, Juventus have now lost two league games in a row and could well be looking over their shoulder at AS Roma in the race for the title.</p>
<h1 id="Lazio-suffer-setback-in-title-challenge-with-home-defeat"><a href="#Lazio-suffer-setback-in-title-challenge-with-home-defeat" class="headerlink" title="Lazio suffer setback in title challenge with home defeat"></a>Lazio suffer setback in title challenge with home defeat</h1><p>Lazio suffered a setback in their title challenge as they were beaten 3-1 at home by Atalanta.</p>
<p>The visitors took the lead in the ninth minute when Duvan Zapata finished clinically from Josip Ilicic’s through ball. Djibril Couple doubled the lead shortly before halftime, volleying home a rebound after Etrit Berisha had pushed away Felipe Anderson’s free kick.</p>
<p>Simone Inzaghi’s side pulled one back early in the second half through Filipe Anderson, but Manuel Lanzini sealed Atalanta’s victory with a late goal.</p>
<p>The result leaves Lazio three points behind leaders Napoli, who have a game in hand, and seven adrift of Juventus.</p>
<h1 id="Inter-Milan-move-into-fourth-place-with-victory-over-Cagliari"><a href="#Inter-Milan-move-into-fourth-place-with-victory-over-Cagliari" class="headerlink" title="Inter Milan move into fourth place with victory over Cagliari"></a>Inter Milan move into fourth place with victory over Cagliari</h1><p>Inter Milan moved into fourth place in Serie A on Sunday with a 3-1 victory over Cagliari. The home side got off to the perfect start when Matias Vecino headed them in front after just three minutes, and they doubled their advantage nine minutes later when Stefan De Vrij headed in from a corner.</p>
<p>The lead was reduced in the second half when Leonardo Pavoletti scored from close range, but Mauro Icardi sealed the win for Inter with a late penalty. The result sees Inter move up to fourth place in Serie A, one point behind Lazio and four behind third-placed Roma.</p>
<p>“We knew it would be a difficult game against Cagliari, who are physical and very well organised,” said Inter manager Luciano Spalletti. “But we played some excellent football and deserved to win. We’re up to fourth now and we’ll fight to stay there.”</p>
<h1 id="AC-Milan-held-to-frustrating-draw-by-Chievo"><a href="#AC-Milan-held-to-frustrating-draw-by-Chievo" class="headerlink" title="AC Milan held to frustrating draw by Chievo"></a>AC Milan held to frustrating draw by Chievo</h1><p>AC Milan were held to a frustrating draw by Chievo on Sunday evening. The Rossoneri failed to take their chances, with Chievo keeper Stefano Sorrentino in inspired form.</p>
<p>The home side started strongly, and came close to taking the lead in the fourth minute. Giacomo Bonaventura’s free-kick was tipped over the bar by Sorrentino.</p>
<p>Milan continued to dominate possession, but struggled to create clear-cut chances. Chievo defenders were well organised, and kept strikers Nikola Kalinic and Andre Silva at bay.</p>
<p>The visitors only created one chance in the first half, with Mariusz Stepinski firing over the bar from close range.</p>
<p>Chievo came out of the blocks strongly in the second half and had two good chances to take the lead. First, Stepinski curled an effort just wide of Gianluigi Donnarumma’s goal. Then Manuel Pucciarelli saw his header saved by Donnarumma.</p>
<p>Milan finally woke up and had a few chances of their own. Sorrentino made a good save from Bonaventura’s free-kick, before denying Suso from close range.</p>
<p>Kalinic then came close to scoring, but his header was blocked by Sorrentino. The striker then had a penalty appeal turned down after he went down under a challenge from Dario Dainelli.</p>
<p>Silva also went close late on, but his effort was dragged just wide of the post. The result means that Milan have now failed to win any of their last three games in all competitions.</p>
